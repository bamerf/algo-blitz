‚ùì PROMPT
Given an org chart of a company, employee A, and employee B: figure out if employee B is a direct report to employee A.

Employee B must report directly to employee A - this occurs if Employee A is the parent node of Employee B.

Employees in our tree are represented as integer values (eg: 1).

Return true if employee A manages employee B, false if not.

Example(s)
      1  <---- ceo
   2   3
      4  5
     6  
isDirectReport(ceo, 1, 2) == True
isDirectReport(ceo, 1, 4) == False
isDirectReport(ceo, 2, 1) == False
isDirectReport(ceo, 2, 3) == False
