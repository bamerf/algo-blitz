‚ùì PROMPT
You are asked to design a simple printer queue.

The printer can only perform one operation at a time and processes the print jobs in the order they are added to the queue. The actions parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains one of the following commands:

("add", "document_name"): Add a new document to the print queue.
("print",): Print the next document in the queue.
("cancel", "document_name"): Cancel a document in the queue. If the document is not in the queue, do nothing.
The function should return a list of strings representing the names of the printed documents in the order they were printed.

result = printer_queue(actions)
print(result)  # Output: ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3']

<space />

Hint: What is the difference between a stack and a queue, and why do we use a queue in this question?

A: Queues follow First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, whereas Stacks are Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. We use a queue in this particular problem because the documents added to the queue should be printed in the order it was added.

    ("cancel", "doc1"), # Remove 'doc1' from the queue (do nothing)
    ("add", "doc3"),    # Add 'doc3' to the queue
    ("print",),         # Print 'doc2' from the queue to the printed queue
    ("print",)          # Print 'doc3' from the queue to the printed queue

actions = add, print, cancel

add = prepend item to an array
print = log the last item in the array
cancel = if item being logged is last item, stop logging
